Hi! My name is Sophie, and I am a senior web developer.

I completed my BSc in computer science in 2019 with an average grade of 96.77.

For the past 4.5 years (mid 2017 - 2022), I have been working as a Full Stack developer at [FeezBack](https://www.linkedin.com/company/feezback/).
During my time there, I had the opportunity to work on a variety of projects and collaborate with a talented team of developers, designers, and project managers.

In my third year at FeezBack, I was the sole hands-on developer, as the startup had significantly shrunk to only 3 people, including the CEO and the CTO.
I believe that my contributions were crucial in facilitating the company's growth to 13 employees.

In my last year of employment at FeezBack, I was promoted to a senior developer, where I took on additional responsibilities and took a key role in designing and building two systems from scratch. I also actively participated in design meetings with clients, providing valuable insights and recommendations.

Throughout my career, I have designed and implemented end-to-end features and integrations. 
I have also actively participated in design meetings with clients, providing valuable insights and recommendations. 

In addition to my work as a developer, I volunteer as a guide with [IGY](https://igy.org.il/en/), where I guide a group of LGBTQIA+ teenagers from religious families. 

I look forward to joining a team that values open and honest communication, shares my passion for innovation, and aims to make a positive impact on the world.
